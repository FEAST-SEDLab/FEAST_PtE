Introduction: What is FEAST?
----------------------------
The Fugitive Emissions Abatement Simulation Toolkit or FEAST is a model to evaluate the effectiveness of methane leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs at oil and gas facilities. Recent advances in the development of new fixed and mobile (truck-, drone-, plane-, and satellite-based) methane leak detection technologies have led to growing interest in alternative LDAR programs. Thus, FEAST can also be used to compare the relative effectiveness of new technologies and methods as part of LDAR programs. FEAST uses publicly available data-sets on methane emissions and recent data from field tests of new methane leak detection technologies to simulate the performance of LDAR programs. 

A Brief History of FEAST
------------------------
FEAST was initially developed at the Environmental Assessment and Optimization group at Stanford University and
released in 2016 (C.Kemp et al. Environ. Sci. Tech. 50 4546 http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b06068). The latest version of FEAST, version 3.1, incorporates additional emission data sets, improves parametric representations of new technologies and methods, and explicitly accounts for leaks (unintentional) and vents (intentional) within the simulated oil and gas facility.

Jupyter notebook tutorial
-------------------------
FEAST includes a jupyter notebook that can serve as a tutorial. We host a live jupyter notebook that you can access to run FEAST examples without any software installed on your machine. If you want to try out the model quickly and do not need to save your work, follow the "quick access" link below. You may use any username to log in to the notebook. In order to save your work, you will need to have a github account and use it to log in to the jupyter notebook via the "github supported" link below.
