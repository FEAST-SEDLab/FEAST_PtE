Introduction: What is FEAST?
----------------------------
The Fugitive Emissions Abatement Simulation Toolkit or FEAST is a model to evaluate the effectiveness of methane leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs at oil and gas facilities. Recent advances in the development of new fixed and mobile (truck-, drone-, plane-, and satellite-based) methane leak detection technologies have led to growing interest in alternative LDAR programs. Thus, FEAST can also be used to compare the relative effectiveness of new technologies and methods as part of LDAR programs. FEAST uses publicly available data-sets on methane emissions and recent data from field tests of new methane leak detection technologies to simulate the performance of LDAR programs. 

A Brief History of FEAST
------------------------
FEAST was initially developed at the Environmental Assessment and Optimization group at Stanford University and
released in 2016 (C.Kemp et al. Environ. Sci. Tech. 50 4546 http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b06068). The latest version of FEAST, version 3.1, incorporates additional emission data sets, improves parametric representations of new technologies and methods, and explicitly accounts for leaks (unintentional) and vents (intentional) within the simulated oil and gas facility.

Jupyter notebook tutorial
-------------------------
Clicking the link below will direct you to a jupyter notebook server that demonstrates a few basic simulations in FEAST. The server will not support advanced simulations and your results will not be maintained indefinitely, so it should be used as an educational tool rather than an analysis platform. Enter any username and password to access the server. By recording your username and password you will be able to reaccess your work after the server times out.
