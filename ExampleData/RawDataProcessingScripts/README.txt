The data processing files are meant to be run here as scripts. For example, in order to execute
COGCC_2019_productiondata.py, navigate to the parent directory of FEAST and enter the command

python -m ExampleData.RawDataProcessingScripts.COGCC_2019_productiondata

If the script is run without the -m flag, relative imports will fail.
